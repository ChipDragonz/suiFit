# FitSui - Next-Gen Web3 Fitness Arena

**"Your Sweat, Your Assets – Verified by AI on Sui Network."**

FitSui is a revolutionary Web3 Fitness dApp built on the Sui Network that bridges the gap between physical effort and digital value. By leveraging AI Pose Estimation, we ensure a "Physical Proof of Work" (P-PoW) where every reward is earned through genuine physical exercise.
